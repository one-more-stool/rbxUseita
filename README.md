A Windows application that allows you to run multiple RBX game instances simultaneously by managing the singleton event handles that normally prevent this.

## Features

- üéÆ **Multi-Instance Support**: Run multiple Rbx games at once
- üîß **Easy to Use**: Simple one-click unblocking with visual indicators
- üì¶ **Portable**: Single executable with no external dependencies
- üåç **Multi-Language Support**: 29 languages with automatic system language detection
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Configuration**: Automatic settings persistence in `config.ini`
- üö´ **Clean**: No unwanted files (no `imgui.ini` or log files)

## How It Works

Rbx normally prevents multiple game instances by creating a singleton event handle (`Rbx_singletonEvent`). This application:

1. Finds all running Rbx processes
2. Identifies which ones have the blocking singleton event
3. Allows you to close these handles with a single click
4. Enables new Rbx instances to start

## Usage

1. Launch the game
2. Run rbxUseita
3. Toggle autounblocking checkbox
4. Start new game as much as you want

## Configuration

The application automatically creates a `config.ini` file to store user preferences:

```ini
# rbxUseita Configuration File
# This file stores user preferences

# Auto-unblock setting (true/false)
autoUnblock=false

# User interface language
language=en
```

### First Run
- Language is automatically detected based on your Windows system language
- If your system language is not supported, English is used as default
- All settings are automatically saved when changed in the UI

## Building

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2019/2022 or Build Tools
- CMake 3.15+

### Build Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd rbxUseita
# Clone Imgui
git clone https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Executable Compression with UPX

The project automatically compresses the Release executable using UPX for smaller file size. UPX is downloaded automatically during the first build.

#### Automatic UPX Integration
- UPX is automatically downloaded during CMake configuration
- Supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems
- Uses the latest stable version (5.0.2)
- Automatically detects system architecture

#### Manual UPX Usage (Optional)
```bash
# Compress executable manually
upx --best --lzma rbxUseita.exe
```

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C++17
- **UI Framework**: Dear ImGui (no `imgui.ini` file created)
- **Graphics API**: DirectX 11
- **Build System**: CMake
- **Architecture**: x32/x64
- **Localization**: 29 languages with automatic system detection
- **Configuration**: INI-based settings persistence
- **Compression**: UPX automatic compression (70% size reduction)
- **Clean Design**: No log files or temporary files created

### No Rbx Windows Detected
- Make sure Rbx is running
- Run program with admin rights
